== About Easy Poll Client

Easy Poll Client is an Android application to attend polls.

The application will be realized to process the simple text format of a 
server application (Easy Poll Server) and display the polls and their 
questions on a smart phone. The smart phone user can enter
her/his answers and post them to the server application.


The project is subject of an assignment. Further the authors get familiar
with Android software development.
